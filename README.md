# hotel_access_ctrl_1
The system consists of hotel controllers (RedDragon429 development platform), room controller (STM32F103C8T6 designed pcb), room thermostat (STM32F746ZET designed pcb) and writer/reader for MIFARE cards. RS485 is used to communicate between hotel controllers and room controllers. Each room controller has an individual 16-bit address, a 16-bit group address and a 16-bit broadcast address. All addresses can be adjusted. Each room controller generates and memorates the event log that is transferred every 3 to 10 seconds to the hotel controller, which is still downloaded by the PC application. Communication inside the room is single-wired data + GND. The hotel controller has embedded web server for setting up, update room controllers, temostates, display image change, and more... Tftp server is used transfer new files to a hotel controller uSD card over the network. The complete hardware design is in the "hw" folder.
